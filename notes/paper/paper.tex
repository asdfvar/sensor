\begin{abstract}
Body worn sensors have been used in the market for many years now. Most of which are used specifically for activity monitoring or fitness. In this paper, we present a method for real-time activity classification, from accelerometers worn by the user, by using the matched-filter method. We also discuss the methods used to improve computational efficiency, and the unsupervised learning method for training the device to recognize motion patterns provided by the user.

\section{Introduction}
Body worn sensors have been used in the market for many years now. Most of which are used specifically for activity monitoring or fitness. While pedometers are common and effective devices used, not many actively identify the activity of the individual for real-time processing. In this paper, we developed a method to identify the individual’s activity in real-time and feed that back to the person or device for further analysis. Having an a priori knowledge of the activity the individual is performing is useful for many current fitness algorithms. These devices (Fit-Bit, Apple watch, Moov, Jawbone, etc.) usually have the individual input the activity they are performing.

\subsection{Activity Identification}
The matched-filter method is commonly used for extracting a signal out of noisy data. We employ this method for identifying a user’s activity from data generated by body-worn accelerometers. Because the matched-filter method requires use of an existing reference template to identify the desired signal, we must develop our template from a training set. We will discuss how we develop our set of templates for use in our matched-filter.

\subsection{Dimensionality Reduction}
e manage to reduce our computational resources and remove our dependence on sensor orientation at the same time through a process of dimensionality reduction. We base our assumption that over a short period of time a user’s limb movement is constrained mostly to a two-dimensional plane. By identifying the plane of motion, we then project the acceleration data onto this plane and re-define our x and y axis accordingly. Because most common activities are mostly confined to two dimensions, this will improve our signal identification.
